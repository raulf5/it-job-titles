## DevOps
The DevOps Evangelist
The DevOps Evangelist is the change agent responsible for owning and delivering change toward a DevOps culture. The DevOps Evangelist is responsible for ensuring the success and implementation of all DevOps processes and team identity.

DevOps Evangelist main duties consist of:

Promote the benefits of DevOps
Ensure buy-in from both development and operations teams
Determine the key roles
Ensure all team members are trained
 

The Code Release Manager
The Code Release Manager typically holds the Project Manager role in a DevOps model. Additionally, the Code Release Manager must also have the technical knowledge and expertise to run and maintain the process of product and application development and delivery. A DevOps Code Release manager must also understand how and when to leverage agile methodologies.

Code Release Manager Main Duties:

Project manage products and applications from development through deployment
Track the progress of DevOps using impact and other key metrics
 

The Automation Architect
The Automation Architect is essential to a DevOps team because DevOps is all about automating systems. It’s the Automation Architect’s responsibility to create processes that use automation to help reduce manual tasks. They are responsible for creating a more efficient process and finding the right tools to use and integrate within a DevOps model.

Automation Architect Main Duties:

Design and implement strategies for automating manual tasks
Find the right DevOps tools for different processes
 

The Experience Assurance Expert (XA)
The Experience Assurance Expert is along the lines of quality assurance, but it is largely tied to the customer experience and its simplicity in terms of use. The Experience Assurance Expert, or XA, is the person responsible for creating a smooth user experience of the final product. Think of the XA as an advocate for the customer. They are making sure the end product not only works correctly and has the right features, but also that it’s easy to use.

XA Main Duties:

Verify all features outlined in the original specifications are in the final product
Ensure a smooth and enjoyable user experience across the product and all features
 

The Software Developer/Tester
The Software Developer is the product builder. They are the ones responsible for writing the code, and in a DevOps setting, the developer also performs unit testing and deployment, as well as ongoing monitoring. This is a bit more of an expanded role compared to the traditional developer, which was mostly concerned with just writing code.

Software Developer/Tester Main Duties:

Write the code for new products, features, security updates, and bug fixes
Ensure all lines of code are up to original business requirements
Perform unit testing
Perform deployments
Monitor product performance
 

The Security & Compliance Engineer
The Security and Compliance Engineer (SCE) is the person responsible for the overall security of the system. In DevOps, the SCE works right alongside development and is able to integrate their security recommendations while the product is being built rather than during post-production.They work closely with all departments and roles to ensure the company is being safe with its data and is in compliance with the necessary requirements.

SCE Main Duties:

Ensure products are in compliance with all established standards and regulations
Work alongside development to ensure product is safe and secure against possible attacks
